We've been working on integrating YASK with Devito so that Devito users can exploit the YASK technology in a seamless fashion, w/o having to change their code. After months of work, we're finally in a position in which we can run some non-trivial `Operator`s, while reusing all of the Devito infrastructure presented so far (including the symbolic optimizations provided by the DSE). In this section, we show how simple is it from a user point-of-view to exploit YASK in Devito -- no more difficult than setting an environment variable ! Then, we also look at performance of the acoustic `Operator` w/ and w/o YASK."
