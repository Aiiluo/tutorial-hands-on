    "Welcome to the interactive hands-on tutorial for [Devito](http://www.opesci.org/devito-public). Devito is a domain-specific language (DSL) and code generation framework for the design of highly optimised finite difference kernels, and was primarily designed for use in seismic inversion methods. Devito utilises SymPy to allow the definition of matrix-free finite difference operators from high-level symbolic equations and generates optimised and automatically tuned code specific to a given target architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on tutorial is intended to give you an initial flavour of the Devito framework and the power of symbolic computation. We will demonstrate how quickly explicit finite difference operators can be created from only a few lines of Python code, and how we can use them to implement complex imaging algorithms in very little time (literally!). For a more in-depth overview (and as cheat-sheet if you can speed read), you can find another set of [tutorial notebooks](http://www.opesci.org/devito/tutorials.html) on our webpage that go through the covered topics in more detail."

    "On entering the tutorial you should have been given an IP adress for your own cloud instance that contains the full setup for this tutorial. To get started, you should log into this node and execute the following commands to start the Jupyter Notebook server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd devcon-tutorial\n",
    "jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the notebook server is running you need to do the following to enable SSH tunnelling on your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 username@your_remote_host_ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that is setup you should simply open the following in your browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "localhost:8888\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should see a set of Jupyter notebooks, inlcuding this one called ```00_index.ipynb```. The procedure is explained in more detail [here](http://amber-md.github.io/pytraj/latest/tutorials/remote_jupyter_notebook)."
